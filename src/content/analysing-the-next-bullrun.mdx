## 1.Introduction

<span id='1-introduction'></span>

The cryptocurrency market has, over the past decade, evolved from a niche
curiosity to a global financial force to be reckoned with. It's a realm where
fortunes are made and lost in the blink of an eye, where innovation meets
speculation, and where the financial landscape is being reshaped before our
eyes.

In this ever-evolving landscape, one phenomenon has consistently captured the
attention of investors, speculators, and enthusiasts alike: _the crypto bull run_.
It's not just a surge in prices; it's a tidal wave of enthusiasm and investment
that can reshape the entire market. As we embark on this journey into the world
of cryptocurrencies, we'll explore the significance of a potential crypto bull
run, a phenomenon that can send shockwaves through the financial world.

In this article, we'll dive deep into the factors that have the potential to
ignite the next crypto bull run and influence its magnitude. We'll traverse the
economic landscape, examining how global forces, institutional interest, and
market dynamics can play a pivotal role. We'll also explore the regulatory
environment and its potential impact on the crypto market, an increasingly
critical factor in today's interconnected world.

Furthermore, we'll journey through the heart of the crypto market, focusing on
_Bitcoin's cycles_ and their role as a bellwether for the broader digital asset
ecosystem. We'll delve into historical comparisons and patterns, drawing upon
past bull runs for insights into what might lie ahead.

## 2. Understanding the Crypto Market Dynamics

#### _2.1 Volatility_

It's widely known that cryptocurrency markets exhibit extreme volatility. In
fact, the crypto market is renowned for its exceptional liquidity, making it one
of the most fluid markets globally. It's not uncommon to witness price surges of
over 100% or dramatic declines of 100%.

#### _2.2 The Historical Significance of Bull Runs in Cryptocurrency_

For those not well-versed in the dynamics of a bull run, it represents a period
of remarkable prosperity and robust economic growth within the cryptocurrency
market. Conversely, its antithesis, the 'bear market,' is currently holding sway
as we write this. It's crucial to note that the last bull run, or bull market,
unfurled in the remarkable stretch from 2020 to 2021, culminating in Bitcoin's
ascent to a staggering peak of over $63,000 in October 2021. Presently, the
cryptocurrency giant hovers at a comparatively modest $25,000, underlining the
cyclical nature of these market dynamics. This stark contrast serves as a
testament to the profound significance of bull runs within the cryptocurrency
ecosystem.

Here are some of the defining characteristics that typically accompany a bull
market:

- **Explosive Market Cap Growth**: The total market capitalization surges to
  multiples of its bear market counterpart.

- **Proliferation of New Ventures**: A surge in new cryptocurrency projects,
  reflecting the heightened optimism and appetite for innovation during these
  periods.

- **Flourishing Opportunities in Web3**: The demand for web3-related skills and
  employment opportunities reaches a zenith, as blockchain technologies gain
  further traction.

- **Exuberant Optimism and Hype**: Bull markets are often marked by an excess of
  optimism and an overarching sense of euphoria among investors.

- **Exaggerated Price Swings and Profits**: Prices witness rapid, sometimes
  exaggerated, increases, driving substantial profits for early investors.

These are hallmarks of a bull market, encapsulating both the opportunities and
risks that come with this exhilarating phase in the cryptocurrency journey.

#### _2.3 Importance of  analysis_

Investing in cryptocurrencies may seem like a lucrative endeavor during a bull run, 
but this enthusiasm and wealth accumulation can be short-lived. To outperform the 
market and prepare for the inevitable downturn at the end of a bull run, thorough
analysis is essential. While cryptocurrency markets are not an exact science, we 
can identify patterns and make predictions by analyzing various factors.


## 3. Economic Factors 

Economic factors play a significant role in influencing the sentiment and behavior 
of the cryptocurrency market. Factors such as the expansion of credit, 
attention-grabbingnews, or even a single tweet can trigger impulsive buying or 
selling of assets. 

Additionally, regulatory speculations, like those concerning the SEC, can directly 
impact the capital flowing into the crypto ecosystem.

#### _3.1 Inflation and the devaluation of fiat currencies_
One of the key economic drivers affecting the cryptocurrency market is inflation and
the devaluation of fiat currencies. When a currency experiences high levels of 
inflation, savers and investors become wary of holding onto it, as it steadily erodes
their purchasing power. People often seek to preserve their wealth by exchanging the
devaluing currency for consumer goods or other tangible assets like gold or 
alternative currencies.


This phenomenon is particularly common in countries with highly devalued national
currencies, such as Argentina. To illustrate the impact of inflation on major reserve 
currencies, let's examine the supply dynamics of two prominent currencies: the USD 
and Euro.

_EUR money supply over time_

As evident from the graphs, both the USD and Euro have experienced significant increases
in their money supplies over the past two decades. The Euro's supply has surged by 600%,
while the USD's supply has witnessed a staggering 1,000% increase. Notably, the USD 
underwent a substantial devaluation in 2020, with its supply skyrocketing from 
approximately 4,000 billion to over 20,000 billion in just two years.

We can see this happening and even worse in lots of fiat currencies worlwide. This opens
a new world of opportunities for crypto, since this phenomenon can make people invest 
more in crypto. When it comes to Bitcoin, we know for certain what the supply is going
to be at any moment. Furthermore, it is designed to be deflationary, opposite to 
inflationary. This incentivices users to save in this currency.

#### _3.2 Institutional interest and investment_

Financial are for a lot of insecure investors a synonimn of confidence. Seeing new about
famous institutions deciding to invest into assets such as Bitcoin is extremey positive 
since it contributes to debanking the myth that all the cryptos are a scam by nature, like
a lot of regular people may think. Here some of this institutions that announced they would
include bitcoin investments in the past: 

1. **Grayscale Investments**: While not a traditional bank, Grayscale is a significant player in the cryptocurrency investment space. It offers various cryptocurrency investment trusts, including the Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC), which allows institutional investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin.

2. **MicroStrategy**: A publicly-traded business intelligence firm, MicroStrategy made headlines by converting a substantial portion of its treasury reserve into Bitcoin. The company continues to invest in Bitcoin as a hedge against currency devaluation.

3. **Tesla**: In early 2021, Tesla, an electric vehicle manufacturer led by Elon Musk, announced that it had purchased $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin and would accept Bitcoin as payment for its products.

4. **Square**: The payments company founded by Jack Dorsey (also the CEO of Twitter) invested $50 million in Bitcoin in 2020 and has been actively promoting cryptocurrency adoption through its Cash App.

5. **Fidelity Investments**: Fidelity, one of the world's largest asset managers, has launched Fidelity Digital Assets, a subsidiary dedicated to offering cryptocurrency custody and trading services to institutional clients.

6. **Guggenheim Partners**: Guggenheim, a global investment and advisory firm, filed with the SEC to allocate part of its Macro Opportunities Fund to Bitcoin in late 2020.

7. **Paul Tudor Jones**: While not an institution per se, Paul Tudor Jones, a billionaire hedge fund manager, publicly disclosed his Bitcoin investments as a hedge against inflation.

8. **MassMutual**: The Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company purchased $100 million worth of Bitcoin in December 2020 as part of its general investment fund.

9. **Stanley Druckenmiller**: Renowned hedge fund manager Stanley Druckenmiller has expressed his interest in Bitcoin as a store of value, indicating that he owns some Bitcoin.

10. **JPMorgan Chase**: Although Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan's CEO, has been critical of Bitcoin in the past, the bank has reportedly started offering banking services to cryptocurrency exchanges, signaling some level of involvement.


#### _3.3 Global economic instability and uncertainty_


#### _3.4 Central bank interest rates_
As mentioned before, year 2020(COVID year) the money supply of USD first and EUR after was
increased. The first one led to very low interest rates and almost-free credit, stimulating
the US economy. The EU did pretty much the same, stimulating the EU economy with cheap credit. 

Soon after, the side-effects of this irresponsible monetary policy showed up. In may 2022, the 
year-on-year CPI in US was 9.1%. Right after, the Eurozone started to suffer inflation too,
and combined to some "geopolitical conflicts", the average for the Eurozone was 10.6% year-on-year
CPI in october 2022. Furthermore, some countries were especially affected such as Estonia; 24.8%
year-on-year CPI on august 2022.

In this context of inflation(where inflation was not only caused by monetary reasons) central banks
started to take action and raising interest rates progressively.
