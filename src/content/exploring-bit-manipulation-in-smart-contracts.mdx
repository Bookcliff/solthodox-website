## 1.Introduction

<span id='1-introduction'></span>

In the realm of computer storage, bits and bytes are the fundamental building
blocks. Understanding how values are stored in binary is crucial for efficient
data manipulation, and this knowledge is equally vital in the Ethereum Virtual
Machine (EVM).

Bit manipulation, or bitwise operations, plays a pivotal role in optimizing
smart contract development. By harnessing the power of binary operators,
developers can efficiently pack data, reducing gas costs, and enhancing the
performance of their contracts.

## 2. Understanding Bits in Solidity

#### _2.1 Bits explained_

<span id='2-1-bits-explained'></span>

If you're not well-versed in the world of bits, it's time to dive in. In
essence, bits are individual storage units that can be in one of two states: set
(1) or unset (0).Just think of them as a row of light bulbs that are either on
or off. With this logic, we can store values in their binary representation, a
set of 0(unset) and 1(set). Just like bits storage, binary numbers are read from
right to left. If you're new to binary numbers, you can check out this
informative
[article](https://medium.com/@syedatasneem958/number-systems-conversions-49f8144c8cf2)
for a detailed explanation.

For example, the binary representation of the number 9 is "1001." This can be
stored by setting the first and fourth bits to 1. This binary storage system is
versatile, allowing us to store not only numeric values but also strings,
hexadecimal numbers, arrays, and more. A group of 8 bits is referred to as a
"byte." For instance, the number 255, represented in binary as "11111111,"
occupies 1 byte.

In Solidity, we encounter statically typed values, which means that for values
with fixed sizes, their maximum size is known from the outset::

- uint/int*n*: Here, "n" denotes the number of bits the value occupies. For
  instance, "uint256" occupies 256 bits. Unlike some other languages, such as
  Rust, which restrict numeric values to a maximum of 32 bits, Solidity provides
  native support for 256-bit numeric values. This allows for the storage of
  large values.
- bytes*n* : In this case, "n" represents the number of bytes the value
  occupies. "bytes32" takes up 32 bytes (equivalent to 256 bits).
- bool : Booleans take up only 1 byte. While it could technically take just 1
  bit (with 1 for true and 0 for false), computers are more efficient at reading
  whole bytes.

Dynamic values, on the other hand, can occupy varying amounts of space, such as
arrays, strings, and bytes.

It's important to note that EVM storage is organized in 32-byte slots, making it
more efficient for the EVM to read two values within the same slot than separate
ones. Henceforth, we'll refer to a 32-byte space as a "word."

### 2.2 Why Bit Manipulation in Solidity?

<span id='2-2-why-bit-manipulation-in-solidity'></span>

Now, let's delve deeper into the advantages of bit manipulation in Solidity:

- **Efficient Storage Packing**: Bit-level manipulation empowers developers to
  tailor the maximum bit size of their values and pack them efficiently into a
  single word. While using a struct is an option, it necessitates the use of
  Solidity's default types with preset sizes, which may not always align with
  the most convenient sizes for our values.

- **Gas Savings**: A more efficient storage layout translates to more efficient
  data retrieval, resulting in reduced gas costs when accessing storage.
  Additionally, employing binary operators for arithmetic operations can also
  lead to reduced gas costs. This efficiency stems from the fact that computers
  are inherently more adept at handling operations at the bit level.

A shining example of these advantages can be found in the AAVE v2 protocol's
"ReserveConfigurationMap," a bitmap where bit manipulation optimizes data
storage:

```solidity
 struct ReserveConfigurationMap {
    //bit 0-15: LTV
    //bit 16-31: Liq. threshold
    //bit 32-47: Liq. bonus
    //bit 48-55: Decimals
    //bit 56: Reserve is active
    //bit 57: Reserve is frozen
    //bit 58: Borrowing is enabled
    //bit 59: Stable rate borrowing enabled
    //bit 60-63: Reserved
    //bit 64-79: Reserve factor
    uint256 data;
  }
```

Here, the AAVE protocol stores all data related to reserve configuration in a
single word, a "bitmap." This bitmap allows complete customization of the sizes
of internal values, such as "LTV" occupying the first 16 bits, boolean values
("Reserve is active," "Reserve is frozen," "Borrowing is enabled," etc.), which
now only occupy 1 bit each, and the 4-bit value "Reserved." This tight packing
enables the EVM to read just once (1 slot) to access all these values
efficiently. To read and write values directly from the bitmap, binary operators
and bit masks come into play.

## 3. Basic Bitwise Operations

<span id='3-basic-bitwise-operations'></span>

Let's now explore some of the fundamental binary operations:

#### _3.1 Bitwise AND ("&") and OR ("|") Operations_

<span id='3-1-bitwise-&-and-|-operations'></span>

The "&" operator takes two numbers as inputs and identifies the bit positions
where both numbers have a 1 (hence its name, "and"). It returns a new value by
preserving only the bits that meet this criterion.

```solidity
uint256 n1 = 12; // 01100
uint256 n2 = 24; // 11000
// Only the 4th bit has 1 in both cases; the other bits are set to 0.
                //  01000 = 8
uint256 andResult = n1 & n2;
```

Conversely, the "|" operator also takes two numbers as inputs but identifies the
bit positions where only one of them has a 1 (hence its name, "or"). It creates
and returns a new value based on this criterion.

```solidity
uint256 n1 = 12; // 01100
uint256 n2 = 24; // 11000
// The third and fifth positions have different values, so we keep them.
                //  10100 = 28
uint256 orResult = n1 | n2;
```

These bitwise operations are powerful tools for customizing data storage and
optimizing gas costs in Solidity smart contract development. This two operators
are used for _bitmasking_ usually.

#### _3.2 Bitwise SHL("&laquo;") and SHR("&raquo;") operations_

<span id='3-1-bitwise-<<-and->>-operations'></span>

The SHL (shift-left) operator shifts all bit values one position to the left.
This effectively multiplies the number by 2, as it adds a 0 bit on the right.

```solidity
//...000010111
uint256 n = 23;
//we shift every value one position to the left
//...000101110
n = n << 1; // =46
```

Conversely, the SHR (shift-right) operator shifts all bit values one position to
the right. This operation effectively divides the number by 2, as it removes the
rightmost bit.

```solidity
//...000010111
uint256 n = 23;
//we shift every value one position to the right
//...000001011
n = n >> 1; // = 11
```

As you might have noticed, each left shift doubles the value, and each right
shift halves it. These operators are particularly useful when you need to
perform multiplications or divisions by powers of two, leading to gas savings in
the process.

#### _3.3 Bitwise NOT("~") operations_

<span id='3-3-bitwise-~-operations'></span>

The concept is straightforward: the bitwise NOT operation inverts the bits of a
value, turning 1s into 0s and vice versa.

```
//...00000000000000001
uint256 n = 1;
// Inverted bits: 11111111111111110
n = ~n; // =131070
```

## 4.Bit Manipulation Techniques

<span id='4-bit-manipulation-techniques'></span>

#### _4.1 Accessing a specific set of bits_

<span id='4-1-accessing-a-specific-set-of-bits'></span>

In this section, we will delve deeper into advanced bit manipulation techniques.
Now that we have covered the basics, let's apply our knowledge to extract and
modify specific bits from a bitmap. We will revisit the AAVE example for
practical insights:

```solidity
 struct ReserveConfigurationMap {
    //bit 0-15: LTV
    //bit 16-31: Liq. threshold
    //bit 32-47: Liq. bonus
    //bit 48-55: Decimals
    //bit 56: Reserve is active
    //bit 57: Reserve is frozen
    //bit 58: Borrowing is enabled
    //bit 59: Stable rate borrowing enabled
    //bit 60-63: Reserved
    //bit 64-79: Reserve factor
    uint256 data;
  }
```

Suppose we want to read `decimals` (from bit 48 to 55). To accomplish this, we
employ the following approach:

Two values are defined:

- **RESERVE_DECIMALS_START_BIT_POSITION**: the starting position of decimals:48
- **DECIMALS_MASK** : a mask that makes easier to read the bits we want

```solidity
 uint256 constant RESERVE_DECIMALS_START_BIT_POSITION = 48;
```

```solidity
 // binary representation : 111...111111111100000000111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111
 uint256 constant DECIMALS_MASK = 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF00FFFFFFFFFFFF;
```

Now, let's examine the `getDecimals` function:

```solidity
  function getDecimals(DataTypes.ReserveConfigurationMap storage self)
  internal
  view
  returns (uint256)
  {
    return (self.data & ~DECIMALS_MASK) >> RESERVE_DECIMALS_START_BIT_POSITION;
  }
  // mock data :
  //...101110101000101101100010101110111111110100011000111110011000110111
  // inverted mask (~DECIMALS_MASK):
  //...000000000011111111000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

  // self.data & ~DECIMALS_MASK
  //...000000000000101101000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
  // >> RESERVE_DECIMALS_START_BIT_POSITION
  // Result: Decimal Value                           ..000000000000101101
```

To summarize:

1. The function begins by executing a bitwise AND operation between self.data
   (which contains the configuration map) and the DECIMALS_MASK. This operation
   effectively sets all the bits representing the decimals to 0, allowing us to
   write new values to those bits.

2. To obtain the actual decimal value, it shifts the result 48 positions to the
   right (`>> RESERVE_DECIMALS_START_BIT_POSITION`). This step aligns the
   extracted bits with the least significant position (the rightmost side),
   allowing you to obtain and read the `decimals`.

This technique efficiently extracts and interprets the desired bits,
demonstrating the power of bitwise operations in smart contract development.

#### _4.2 Modifying a specific set of bits_

<span id='4-2-modifying-a-specific-set-of-bits'></span>

Now, let's delve into how to modify the `decimals` in the code:

```solidity
 function setDecimals(DataTypes.ReserveConfigurationMap memory self, uint256 decimals)
    internal
    pure
  {
    require(decimals <= MAX_VALID_DECIMALS, Errors.RC_INVALID_DECIMALS);
    self.data = (self.data & DECIMALS_MASK) | (decimals << RESERVE_DECIMALS_START_BIT_POSITION);
  }
```

1. The function begins by executing a bitwise AND operation between `self.data`
   (which contains the configuration map) and the `DECIMALS_MASK`. This
   operation effectively sets all the bits representing the `decimals` to 0,
   allowing us to write new values to those bits.

2. To write the new decimal value bits, it performs a bitwise OR operation with
   the new value, shifted left by `RESERVE_DECIMALS_START_BIT_POSITION`
   positions. This ensures that only the bits corresponding to the `decimals`
   are modified, leaving the rest of the bitmap intact.

   These techniques showcase how to efficiently extract and modify specific bits
   within a binary structure, further highlighting the versatility of bitwise
   operations in smart contract development.

## 5. Conclusion

manipulation can set you apart. It empowers you to create smart contracts that
not only function efficiently but also save on gas costs, making your
applications more accessible and affordable for users.

mindset. It's a mindset that values efficiency, precision, and economy. By
mastering the art of bit manipulation, you can create blockchain applications
that are not just functional but also sustainable in a gas-constrained
environment. So, embrace the power of bit manipulation, and watch your smart
contracts soar while your gas costs plummet. Happy coding!
